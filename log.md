# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I started the Tic Tac Toe project from the FreeCodeCamp Front End Projects.

**Thoughts:** I had some problems styling with Bootstrap and couldn't do the mainframe fast. I will probably study a little bit more about how to size, position and change the layout using this framework.
