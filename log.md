# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I started the Tic Tac Toe project from the FreeCodeCamp Front End Projects.

**Thoughts:** I had some problems styling with Bootstrap and couldn't do the mainframe fast. I will probably study a little bit more about how to size, position and change the layout using this framework.

### Day 2: January 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I continued solving the intermidiate algorithms from FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I strugled about some functions in javascript, i was switching and confusing it with some python functions.

### Day 3: January 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I restarted building my personal website.

**Thoughts:** I strugled about using NavBar in BootStrap 4.

### Day 4: January 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I continued trying to build my personal website.

**Thoughts:** I still couldn't be able to fix the problem with the Bootstrap 4, i don't know if the problem is with the Pug(template for Express.js) or the new version of bootstrap 4.

### Day 5: January 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I continued trying to build my personal website.

**Thoughts:** I decide to stop using Pug and building templates with Express.js for now, i will prefer to do it in plain html to get confidence about what i'm building.

### Day 6: January 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I continued trying to build my personal website.

**Thoughts:** I almost didn't do the challenge today. I let it went to the last minutes of the day, i have to be more careful now. I had some problems choosing the color theme to my website and changing the css of it.
